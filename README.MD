#A collection of exploits, shells and binarys. 

#### Most of these are from remote sources and i added the source.txt files where you can find them.

#### Some of these also have a usage.txt file that will explain how to apply the binary.

TODO:
	1. Add usage.txt to all binarys
	2. Add my golang beacons as rshells
